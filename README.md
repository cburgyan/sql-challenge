### You're A New Hire: Project Frame
In this exercise project, you imagine you're a new hire just getting your feet wet by performing basic data analysis on some old company records in the form of six CSV files. You were given these CSV files to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/, create the database in PostgreSQL using pgAmdin4 and extract the CSVs' data into the new database. 

### The Task
You were to then query the database to practice query statement construction using joins, group-by's, order-by's, extract functions, aliases, regex patterns, etc. to meet project specifications such as finding all the managers of the various departments, finding employees with certain name constraints, and counting up the employees with a specific characteristic in common.
